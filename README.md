# Musketeer's Playground

## Hello traveler! 

I created this repo to document my journey of learning world creation for VRChat.

I am coming from the Enfusion engine, where I was creating simple gameplay addons in Enforce script. Now, I will be digging into the possibilities of creating games within the VRChat framework.

The commits here will contain not only my sanity but also all the scripts I create during my learning journey.

It is just a playground; everything I know will be in the repo, so let's see how it goes.

## I am Musketeer, and this is my story.
